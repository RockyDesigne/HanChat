# HanChat
 - HanChat is a server client chat application for the Windows os
 - It uses the Winsock2 api for the networking
 - It uses raylib for the graphical interface on the client side
 - Also uses the cppc-hannel library for the messages channel which I needed to be thread-safe

** Requires the cpp-channel header library made by Andrei Avram
